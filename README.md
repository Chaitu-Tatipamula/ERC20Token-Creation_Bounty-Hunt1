# ERC20Token Deployment Using HARDHAT

This repo uses hardhat to deploy a ERC20token standard that was created for us using the existing openzeppelin contract 
Here we'll be creating a supply of 999 tokens and also providing a functionality so we could mine the tokens later.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
